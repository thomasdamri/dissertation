= button_to 'Send grades via email', assessment_score_email_path, method: :post, class: 'btn btn-info'
%p Note: In a development environment this button will not send emails, but will instead open them as browser tabs.
Students will only have an email sent if they have a team grade AND an individual weighting for this assessment.
Depending on how many students have grades and weightings, this might open A LOT of tabs.
